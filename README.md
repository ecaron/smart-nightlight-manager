# Internet-enabled children's nightlight
Powered by Node.JS and a variety of types of internet-controllable lights, such as:
* [Philips Hue](https://www2.meethue.com/en-us/)
* [NeoPixel & ESP8266](https://github.com/jasoncoon/esp8266-fastled-webserver)

## Why Does This Exist?
I wanted my kids to have a nightlight in their room that:

* Had programmable color
* Had an adjustable timer (turns off X minutes after being turned on)
* Had an interface to show history of button pushes (so I can see when they were awake)
* Schedule the light to change color on a schedule (so at 7am it turns to blue to indicate "Ok, it's morning time!")

## Live Demos

## What Does This Do?
There is a Node.js web server that runs on the network, connects to the Philips Hue bridge, and listens on the network for some button to get pushed.

Each button gets associated with a light on the network. If the button is pushed and the light is off - the light is turned on (and a timer is started to automatically turn the light off after X minutes). If the button is pushed and the light is on - the light is turned off.

There is also a web application that sets the default color and colors during specific time periods. The web interface - in addition to showing times of button pushes - permits turning the light on with & without the timer, and turning the light off.

## Setup
### Getting The App Running
For the most part, it is a straight-forward Node.js application. After downloading this repo and extracting it to a directory of your choice, run:

* `npm install`
* `npm start`

You can now access http://localhost:3000/ and view the complete interface. (On my home network, I put this behind nginx and set the in-house DNS to know it as "nightlight". So now babysitters and family just go to http://nightlight/ to use it.)

### Environment Configurables
There are some variables that much be defined in the environment before starting the application.
For your convenience, you can also stored these in a `.env` file.

Variable | Purpose | Default
--- | --- | ---
SITE_NAME | Shown in page header and logged with Hue bridge | Nightlight System
NODE_ENV | Determines if application should cache & catch uncaught errors (if set to *production*), or exit | *blank*
PORT | Port app listens on | 3000
SESSION_SECRET | How cookie data is encrypted | secret

### Keeping The App Running
You'll find plenty of other great tutorials on the web about running a Node.js app as a daemon, but here are a couple:
